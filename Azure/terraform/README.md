# Azure cloudswXtch Terraform Example

To use the terraform scripts, first run:

```bash
terraform init
```

then, view the settings in `terraform.tfvars` and fill in the appropriate values for your Azure  environment.

Then run `terraform plan` to view the planned changes, and if they look acceptable, run `terraform apply`.
